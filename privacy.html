            <h2>Section i: Introduction</h2>

            <p>This Privacy Policy serves to elaborate on how we go about collecting, utilizing, and, under specific circumstances, disclosing your personal data. Furthermore, it elucidates the robust measures we have put in place to ensure the security of your personal information. Ultimately, this policy provides insight into the choices you have in relation to the acquisition, utilization, and divulgence of your personal data. By accessing the Site directly or via other platforms, you are not only acknowledging but also agreeing to abide by the practices expounded in this Policy.</p>

            <p>The duration for which we retain your information is circumscribed by legal obligations or its relevance to the original purposes for which it was gathered.</p>

We use Google Analytics, which collects data about site usage. Please refer to our Cookies Policy for more information.</p>

            <p>In connection with your use of the Site, we or our authorized service providers may employ cookies, web beacons, and other comparable technologies.</p>

            <p>Accessing the Site does not necessitate accepting cookies. We would like to draw attention to the fact that using the Site's "basket" feature and placing orders is only feasible when cookies are enabled. Cookies are text files that are stored in your browser's memory or on your device when you visit a website or read a message. They are usually made up of letters and numbers. They enable us to identify a specific device or browser. Web beacons are tiny visual images that could be present on the website.</p>

            <p>They help us better understand your preferences and interests by enabling us to count the number of users who have viewed these pages. When you visit specific pages on the Site, cookies—tiny text files that are saved to your computer's hard drive by your Internet browser—identify your computer to our server as a unique user. Your Internet Protocol address can be recognized by cookies, which will save you time when you visit or want to visit the website.</p>

            <p>We don't collect or use any other information about you, such as targeted advertising; instead, we only use cookies to make your experience on the site easier. For example, cookies help us remember who you are when you want to change your shopping cart without having to enter your email address again. Please be aware, however, that altering or removing cookies may have an impact on the functionality that is available on the Sit. Some cookies are necessary to enable essential functionality (like adding items to your shopping basket). Although you could configure your browser to reject cookies, doing so would limit how you could use the site.</p>

            <p>We assure you that the cookies we use are virus-free and do not contain any personal or private information. Visit all-about-cookies for additional information about cookies, or click this link to learn how to delete them from your browser.</p>

               <h3>Google Analytics</h3>

               <p>Google Analytics, a web analytics service offered by Google, Inc. ("Google"), is used on this website.

Google will receive and store the data produced by the cookie about how you use the website (including your IP address) on servers located in the United States. Google will use this data to assess how you use the site, create reports on website activity for website owners, and offer additional services associated with website activity and internet usage.</p>

               <p>Additionally, if required by law or if such third parties handle the information on Google's behalf, Google may transfer this information to them. Google won't link your IP address to any other information it owns. By choosing the appropriate browser settings, you can refuse the use of cookies; however, please be aware that you might not be able to utilize this website to its fullest extent if you do this. By using this website, you agree that Google may process your personal data for the reasons and in the ways described above.</p>

            <h2>Section xi: Security</h2>
